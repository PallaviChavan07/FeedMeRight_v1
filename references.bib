  abstract  = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is a process to filter information or patterns with collaboration among multiple agents and resources. The main idea of CF is to effectively extract useful information from the overwhelming amount of collected data. This article discusses the perception of CF techniques and explains how to utilize CF in a recommender system (RS). RS provides recommendations to an active user based on items that other similar users prefer. CF makes automatic predictions of a user's interests by utilizing stored data of various users, which makes it a key method for RS.},

  abstract  = {Poor nutrition is one of the major causes of ill-health and death in the western world and is caused by a variety of factors including lack of nutritional understanding and preponderance towards eating convenience foods. We wish to build systems which can recommend nutritious meal plans to users, however a crucial pre-requisite is to be able to recommend recipes that people will like. In this work we investigate key factors contributing to how recipes are rated by analysing the results of a longitudinal study (n=124) in order to understand how best to approach the recommendation problem. We identify a number of important contextual factors which can influence the choice of rating. Based on this analysis, we construct several recipe recommendation models that are able to leverage understanding of user's likes and dislikes in terms of ingredients and combinations of ingredients and in terms of nutritional content. Via experiment over our dataset we are able to show that these models can significantly outperform a number of competitive baselines.},

  abstract  = {Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a recommendation system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A first step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommendation systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss how to compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application. We focus on comparative studies, where a few algorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms. We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms. We review three types of experiments, starting with an offline setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and finally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation. We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from the conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties. We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the properties that they evaluate.},
