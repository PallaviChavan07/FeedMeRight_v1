\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}
The internet is vast network of machines that connects large number of computers together worldwide and allowing them to communicate with one another. The World Wide Web is an information sharing model that is built on top of the internet in which information can be accessed or manipulated easily, which has lead to the dramatic growth in increased usage of internet. One of the results has been the dramatic increase of data and a phenomenon known as BigData.
\\
BigData referes to exponentially increasing data at a high volume, high velocity with variety. This huge amount of data has intrinsic value but provides no utility until it's discovered \cite{2}. With such information overload it is problematic to find exactly what a user is looking for. 
\\
One way to find value in BigData is to deeply analyze it and its interrelated features such as new products, corresponding reviews, ratings and user preferences. Formulating information from raw data is an entire discovery process that requires insightful analysis that would recognize patterns to predict user behaviors to recommend products.
\\
Handling BigData through manual processes is very inefficient. More efficient way of processing such huge amount of data is automating the process of classifying, filtering data of users opinions, features, and preferences in order to understand and predict new set of related products.  Recommender systems are tools that filters information and narrow it down based on user's preferences and helps user to choose which he/she may like. They considers the opinions of communities of users to help each individual in order to understand content of interest from overwhelming information \cite{1}. 
\\ 
Recommender systems can be defined as a tool designed to interact with large and complex information spaces to provide information or items that are relevant to the user \cite{4}.
\\
Today, recommender systems are widely used in variety of applications. Initially it applied for commercial use to analyze data. Amazon is a good example of such an e-commerce website. However, it is now present in several different domains including entertainment, news, books, social tags and some more sophisticated products where personalization is critical such as recipes domain.
According to World Health Organization (WHO) \cite{42}, globally $39\%$ of the adults were over-weighted and $13\%$ were obese in 2016. Overweight and obesity can cause diabetes, blood pressure, heart disease and many other chronic diseases \cite{43}. A well balanced diet plays very important role to improve overall health. With rapid changes in our busy lifestyle, people find it difficult to choose healthy eating option \cite{13}. People tend to move towards options which satisfies their taste or an easy by ignore the health factor which includes required calories and nutrition. Exploring better dishes in such huge information is very tedious. To solve this problem computer scientists can build systems that can help narrowing down the information considering our health and eating history. This thesis further discusses the different approaches for recipe domain to recommend healthy recipes based on user's profile.

The contributions of this paper are the following. First, we provide a short overview of recommendation approaches for individuals. Second, we discuss group decision making issues which have an impact on the development of group recommendation technologies. Third, on the basis of categorizing food recommender systems, we analyze how well those systems can help individuals or groups to choose healthy food which best fits their preferences and health situations. Finally, we point out some challenges of food recommender systems with regard to user information, recommendation algorithms, changing eating behaviors, explanations provision, and group decision making as topics for future work.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide an overview of basic recommendation techniques for individuals and groups. In Section 3, we summarize existing studies on food recommender systems for single users and categorize them according to different criteria, such as preferences, nutritional needs, health problems, and eating behaviors of users. Besides, in this section we also discuss some research related to food recommender systems in group scenarios. Research challenges for food recommender systems are discussed in Section 4. The paper is concluded with Section 5.
