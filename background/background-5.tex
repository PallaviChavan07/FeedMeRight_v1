Various recipe recommender systems are built to understand user's taste based on a user's preferences. The work done by Freyne and Berkosvky uses a content-based technique to recommend recipes based on ingredients \cite{13}. A similar approach is used in the first part of the hybrid approach in this thesis where ingredients, cook methods, and diet labels attributes are used as contents to get more knowledge about a user's preferences. To make this approach towards a healthy diet, calorie restrictions are also applied. The research of Mouzhi Ge, Francesco Ricci, and David Massimo introduced the health factor by incorporating calorie count with a matrix factorization approach\cite{16}. A similar approach is used in the second part of the hybrid approach in this thesis where matrix factorization using the SVD algorithm is used along with calorie restrictions. This thesis aims to build a system that considers a user's preferences along with the health factor. To achieve this goal, the hybrid approach is used in this thesis that uses content-based and collaborative filtering along with calorie restrictions.
