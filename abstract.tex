\noindent With so many rapid changes happening around us, people are moving towards healthy lifestyle which includes choosing right food. Nowadays we are surrounded by overwhelming information which hinders the ability to choose right information. Recommendation system is a technique that would filter information and narrow it down based on our preferences and helps us to choose which we may like.  Recommender systems have been widely used in e-commerce sites, social networking and entertainment industries. To help us in choosing healthy lifestyle recommender systems can be used in recipe domain to choose a right food for us not just based on user's taste but also considering user's lifestyle and calories required for user.  
\\
