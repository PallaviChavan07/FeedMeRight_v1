\noindent With so many rapid changes happening around us, people are moving towards a healthy lifestyle which includes choosing the right food. Today the overabundance of information can hinder the ability to choose the right information. Recommendation systems apply techniques that can filter information and narrow it down based on our preferences or needs and help us to choose what data is important for individuals. Recommender systems have been widely used in e-commerce sites, social networking and entertainment industries. In guiding individuals towards more healthy lifestyles recommender systems can be used in dieting, allowing individuals to find recipes that target specific foods not just based on a user's taste but also considering a user's lifestyle and calories required for that user. This thesis presents the design, implementation and evaluation of various recommendation approaches within the recipe domain. More specifically, combine different recommendation techniques and use machine learning to recommend healthy recipes based on a user's profile.
